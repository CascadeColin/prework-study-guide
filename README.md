A study guide for bootcamp prework.


# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I created this project as a way to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  The creation of this project incorporates elements of all of these topics into a study guide.  This study guide will help me continuously improve on my coding ability throughout my coding bootcamp.  It will store my notes on certain topics by using code to create the notes themselves.  This allows me to take notes and practice coding simultaneously.

The goal of this project is to solve the problem of how to retain the information that I am learning.  By taking notes in the form of code, I am immersing myself in code while taking traditional notes on certain topics I will need to recall later.

The creation of this project taught me the basic building blocks of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  Additionally, I learned how to utilize GitHub, VS Code, and Git Bash as tools of my new trade.  I also hit a significant roadblock while learning Git.  This forced me to utilize "timeboxing" and tested my resolve and determination to continue learning.  Upon getting past that roadblock, I felt the utter joy of defeating the problem which reaffirmed my desire to continue down the path of web development.

## Usage

This website allows me to write and recall notes about the specific topics that it lists.  Additionally, using the DevTools feature of Chrome allows me to see the JavaScript code running under the "console" tab.  There is also a random generation of a topic to study that appears in DevTools that picks a topic of study for me each time I refresh the page.
